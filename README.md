# Roll Dice App 
Simple App that integrates Model / View / ViewModel architecture with Java Code.
#User Case:
as a user I want to be able to roll different types of dice so that I can play a variety of games.

we can assume that the number of sides is also the value limit of the die.
so for a 4 sided die the possible values would be from 1 to 4

example include but are not limited to:
4 sided die
6 sided die
8 sided die
10 sided die
12 sided die
20 sided die
100 sided die
